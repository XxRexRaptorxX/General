# Description how to translate my mods

`Requirements:`
- let me know beforehand
- only translate in your native language
- good english knowledge
- make sure the language is not yet available

-----

`Rewards:`
- you are now part of a mod! yey!
- you are mentioned as a translator in the language file
- you earn a special rank on my discord

-----

`How it works:`
1. your get the file
2. rename the file name to your language (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language => ingame name)
3. it's best to open and edit the file with the program Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
4. add this line on the top of the file:
```j
"_comment": "translated by [your username],"
```
5. translate all names on the right side (if you are not sure what is meant by something, please contact me)
6. when you're done send me the file back on discord or commit it on github if you're familiar with that

-----

# Examples

The part after the colon is the text that you now have to translate:

```json
{
    "_comment": "translated by XxRexRaptorxX,"

    "item.bedrockminer.bedrock_sword": "Bedrock Sword",
    "item.bedrockminer.bedrock_shovel": "Bedrock Shovel",
    "item.bedrockminer.bedrock_pickaxe": "Bedrock Pickaxe",
    "item.bedrockminer.bedrock_axe": "Bedrock Axe",
    "item.bedrockminer.bedrock_hoe": "Bedrock Hoe",
    "item.bedrockminer.bedrock_helmet": "Bedrock Helmet",
}
```

But make sure to keep the text formatting, symbols, spaces or special characters:

```json
{
    "message.nexus.nexus_destruction": " destroyed the Nexus!",
    "message.nexus.gamemode_line_5": "> Assign all players to the teams: /team join <team> [playerName]",
    "message.nexus.hold_shift.desc": "Hold [Shift] for more information.",

    "block.nexus.nexus_red": "§cNexus",
    "block.nexus.nexus_blue": "§9Nexus",
}
```
