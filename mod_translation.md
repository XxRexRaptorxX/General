# Description how to translate my mods
-----

`Requirements:`
- let me know beforehand
- only translate in your native language
- make sure the language is not yet available

-----

`Rewards:`
- you are now part of a mod! yey!
- they are mentioned as a translator in the language file
- you earn a special rank on my discord

-----

`How it works:`
1. your get the file
2. rename the file name to your language
3. it's best to open the file with the program Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
4. add this line on the top of the file:
```j
// translated by [your username]
```
5. translate all names on the right side (if you are not sure what is meant by something, please contact me)
6. when you're done send me the file back on discord or commit it on github if you're familiar with that


The last part before the colon is the text to be translated. The part after the colon now has to be translated by the text to be translated.
