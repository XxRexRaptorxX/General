# You have a bug, error or crash in the game and want to report the error now?

Then the log file of the game is usually required to solve the problem so that the developers can see what is happening at a technical level.

### Here you will find detailed instructions on how to find this file and how best to report it:

# Step 1 - Find the log file

This varies depending on which Minecraft launcher you use.

- ## The Curseforge and most other 3rd-party launcher

1. `Right-click` the desired modpack and choose `Open Folder`.

 2. Open the `logs` folder.


#### [Here](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/249/How-to-find-client-logs-on-modded-Minecraft-launchers.html) you can find instructions for other launchers if you need further help!


- ## The vanilla Minecraft launcher

 1. Find and open your `.minecraft` folder
     - The default path for this is usually as follows: `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`
     - Alternatively, press `Win + R` on your keyboard and type `%appdata%` in the field that appears. Then confirm with `ENTER` and you should be able to see the `.minecraft` folder.

2. Open the `logs` folder

# Step 2 - Share the log

#### It is best to share your logs with the [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/) site, as it hides sensitive information such as ip addresses and formats the log.

1. Drag the `latest.log` file into the page and press `save`.
2. Now your converted log appears. Copy the url (in the address line of your browser).
      - It should look something like this: `https://mclo.gs/MTurevInx`
3. Go to the [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xxrexraptorxx/projects) project page of the corresponding mog and go to the `Issues` tab.
4. See if the same problem has already been reported and if not, open a new one.
5. Now enter all important information about the problem and the link to your log.

----

## Now you have successfully reported a problem in the **right way**! Hurray!
