## You have a bug, error or crash in the game and want to report the error now?

Then the log file of the game is usually required to solve the problem so that the developers can see what is happening at a technical level.

### Here you will find detailed instructions on how to find this file and how best to report it:

## Step 1 - Find the log file

This varies depending on which Minecraft launcher you use.

- ### The Curseforge and most other 3rd-party launcher

1. `Right-click` the desired modpack and choose `Open Folder`.

- ### The vanilla Minecraft launcher

  1. Find and open your `.minecraft` folder
     - The default path for this is usually as follows: `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`
     - Alternatively, press `Win + R` on your keyboard and type `%appdata%` in the field that appears. Then confirm with `ENTER` and you should be able to see the `.minecraft` folder.
