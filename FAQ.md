#### Q: Do you intend to port the mod to an older version?

A: I don't usually do backports.

-----

#### Q: Why are there no more Forge versions?

A: Pretty much the entire old Forge team has parted ways with its founder for understandable reasons and is now developing its own vision of the mod loader. I support this and will only support NeoForge for new MC versions. I advise you to do the same. If you are looking for more information, you can find it [here](https://neoforged.net/news/theproject/).

A: No.

-----

A: Yes, i can always use help. If you know your way around, feel free to contact me and support me! You get something in return! Also, most of my mods are open source on [Github](https://github.com/XxRexRaptorxX) and you can always commit code to me with them.

-----

#### Q: Can i add your mod in my modpack?

A: Yes, but it has to be linked to the project page and the author ([XxRexRaptorxX](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xxrexraptorxx/projects)) has to be mentioned. [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) modpacks meet this criterion by default)

-----
