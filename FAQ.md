#### Q: Do you intend to port the mod to an older version?

A: I don't usually do backports.

-----

#### Q: Why do you prefer to release updates for newer versions?

A: I have to update my mods at some point anyway, so it only makes sense to use my limited time to create the new versions first. Even if I skip minor versions, I still have to implement the part I skipped into the new version afterwards. And above all, if there are already playable mod versions for older MC versions, I prefer to support MC versions that are not yet playable with my mod in order to give more people access to it!

-----

#### Q: Why are there no more Forge versions?

A: Pretty much the entire old Forge team has parted ways with its founder for understandable reasons and is now developing its own vision of the mod loader. I support this and will only support NeoForge for new MC versions. I advise you to do the same. If you are looking for more information, you can find it [here](https://neoforged.net/news/theproject/).

-----

#### Q: Do you also bring the mod for Fabric/Forge/...?

A: No.

-----

#### Q: Can i help you with your mods?

A: Yes, i can always use help. If you know your way around, feel free to contact me and support me! You get something in return! Also, most of my mods are open source on [Github](https://github.com/XxRexRaptorxX) and you can always commit code to me with them.

-----

#### Q: Can i add your mod in my modpack?

A: Yes, but it has to be linked to the project page and the author ([XxRexRaptorxX](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xxrexraptorxx/projects)) has to be mentioned. [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) modpacks meet this criterion by default)

-----

#### Q: Can i make a video/tutorial/let's play/... about your mod or project?

A: Of course! But a mention in the video description would be great. You can send me a link, then it might make it to the project page.

-----
