# You have a bug, error or crash in the game and want to report the error now?      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/e/ea/Redstone_Bug.gif/revision/latest?cb=20201130224258" alt="curseforge launcher" title="I`m a bad bug!" width="60"/>

Then the `log file` of the game is usually required to solve the problem so that the developers can see what is happening at a technical level.

### Here you will find detailed instructions on how to find this file and how best to report it:

# Step 1 - Find the log file

This varies depending on which Minecraft launcher you use.

- ## The Curseforge and most other 3rd-party launcher

1. `Right-click` the desired modpack and choose `Open Folder`.

 2. Open the `logs` folder.


> #### [Here](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/index.php?rp=/knowledgebase/249/How-to-find-client-logs-on-modded-Minecraft-launchers.html) you can find instructions for other launchers if you need further help!


- ## The vanilla Minecraft launcher

 1. Find and open your `.minecraft` folder
     - The default path for this is usually as follows: `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`
     - Alternatively, press `Win + R` on your keyboard and type `%appdata%` in the field that appears. Then confirm with `ENTER` and you should be able to see the `.minecraft` folder.

2. Open the `logs` folder

# Step 2 - Share the log

#### It is best to share your logs with the [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/) site, as it hides sensitive information such as ip addresses and formats the log.

1. Drag the `latest.log` file into the page and press `save`.
2. Now your converted log appears. Copy the url (in the address line of your browser).
      - It should look something like this: `https://mclo.gs/MTurevInx`
3. Go to the [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xxrexraptorxx/projects) project page of the corresponding mod and go to the `Issues` tab.
4. See if the same problem has already been reported and if not, open a new one.
5. Now enter all important information about the problem and the link to your log.
 
 > #### What is important information:
 >   - what exactly happened?
 >   - when did it happen? (at the start of the game, when loading the world, when placing the block, etc.)
 >   - are other mods involved?
 >   - did the whole thing happen in singleplayer or on a server? (if it happens on a server, the [server log](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/knowledgebase/136/How-to-find-and-view-Minecraft-server-logs-and-crash-reports.html) may also be interesting)

## Now you have successfully reported a problem in the **right way**! Hurray!
